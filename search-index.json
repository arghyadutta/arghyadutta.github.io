If $\\mathcal{V}$ and $\\mathcal{W}$ are $m$ and $n$ dimensional vector spaces, then $\\mathcal{V} \\otimes \\mathcal{W}$ (read as 'V tensor W') is an $mn$ dimensional vector space. When we represent a vector in some basis, we order the basis set so that the vector can be written in terms of its 'coordinates' $[\\ket{v}]_\\mathcal{B} \\equiv (c_1,\\cdots,c_n)$. The coordinates depend on the bases . Let $\\mathcal{V}$ be a set of elements (vectors) with two operations, addition and multiplication with a scalar from a field $\\mathbb{F}$ (typically $\\mathbb{C}$ in QM). $\\mathcal{V}$ is a called vector space if for vectors $\\ket{v},\\ket{w},\\ket{x} \\in \\mathcal{V}$ and scalars $c,d \\in \\mathbb{F}$, the following ten conditions are satisfied: For a positive operator : $(\\ket{v},A\\ket{v})\\geq 0$. If it is positive, then $A$ is called positive definite. $A^\\dagger A$ is positive for any operator $A$. $P_i P_j = \\delta_{ij}P_i$ Polar Decomposition Tensor Products Linear Combination Gram–Schmidt method is used to make a linearly independent set of vectors an orthonormal basis set. This is done by normalizing the first vector from the linearly independent set to make it the first basis element, and then progressively making the other vectors orthonormal by removing the projections. Wikipedia has a neat illustration, check it. Also Savov (2020) explained it well. Todo: Add a better synopsis later. Interestingly, for any ket vector in $V$, there exists a bra vector in $V^*$; but for any bra vector, there may not exist a ket vector if the ket belongs to an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space (Cohen Tannoudji 2020 showed a counter-example). For finite-dimensional vector spaces, they are of the same size, and so you'll always get kets corresponding to bras, though. $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(\\ket{0}-i\\ket{1} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\begin{bmatrix}1 \\\\-i\\end{bmatrix} \\equiv \\ket{y_-}$ Spanning set need not be unique . $\\begin{smallmatrix}1 \\\\1 \\end{smallmatrix}$ and $\\begin{smallmatrix}1 \\\\-1 \\end{smallmatrix}$ span $\\mathbb{C}^2$, too.

Inner product in a tensor-product space A map between two vector spaces $\\mathcal{V}$ and $\\mathcal{W}$, $A: \\mathcal{V} \\rightarrow \\mathcal{W}$, that preserves linearity $A (c_1 \\ket{v_1} + c_2 \\ket{v_2}) = c_1 A \\ket{v_1} + c_2 A \\ket{v_2}$. Generally, it has a matrix representation given by $A\\ket{v_j}=\\sum_i A_{ij}\\ket{w_i}$. The representation depends on the basis. Linear Operators Outer-product and Diagonal Representation Kronecker product as matrix representation for $A\\otimes B$ The number of vectors in a basis sets the dimension of the vector space. If $\\mathcal{V}$ has a basis with $n$ vectors, then any set of $m>n$ vectors will be linearly dependent and any set of $m < n$ vectors cannot span $\\mathcal{V}$. (p. 27, Johnston 2021) Cohen Tannoudji (2020) (pp. 103–108) and Mermin (2007) pp. 159–164 for careful definition of bra vectors Associativity: $(\\ket{v}+\\ket{w})+\\ket{x}=\\ket{v}+(\\ket{w}+\\ket{x})$ Distributivity: $(c+d)\\ket{v}=c\\ket{v}+d\\ket{v}$ Outer-product representation reduces to diagonal representation (eigendecomposition/orthonormal decomposition) when $\\ket{v_i}, \\ket{w_j}$ are orthonormal eigenvalues of $A$. $\\rm{Tr}(A\\ket{\\psi}\\bra{\\psi})=\\bra{\\psi}{A}\\ket{\\psi}$ Useful A bra vector is a linear functional $\\mathcal{V} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{C}$; i.e. it takes a ket vector to a complex number: $(\\bra{v})\\ket{w} = \\braket{v}{w}$. Cohen Tannoudji (2020) showed that the space of all such linear functionals forms another vector space $V^*$—known as the dual space of $V$ (pp. 103–108). A bra vector is an element of $V^*$ . A bra vector can also be represented as an adjoint vector: $\\ket{v}^\\dagger \\equiv \\bra{v}$. $z(\\ket{v}\\otimes\\ket{w})=(z\\ket{v})\\otimes\\ket{w}=\\ket{v}\\otimes(z\\ket{w})$ Spectral Decomposition Mermin, N.

Interesting: The Identity matrix *cannot* be written as a linear combination of Pauli matrices. Computational Basis If $\\mathcal{V}$ is a vector space and $\\mathcal{S} \\subseteq \\mathcal{V}$, then $\\mathcal{S}$ is a subspace iff it is closed under addition and scalar multiplication. (You need not check all ten properties. See p. 9, Johnston (2021) for a proof). Linear Dependence and Independence A unitary operator is a normal operator with $A^\\dagger A = A A^\\dagger=I$. Since $U$ is normal, it's diagonalizable, too. $U$ preserves inner product $(U\\ket{v}, U\\ket{w}) = \\ket{v}\\ket{w}$. $U = \\sum_i \\ket{w_i}\\bra{v_i}$ Closure under addition: $\\ket{v} + \\ket{w} \\in \\mathcal{V}$ $\\rm{Tr}(A+B)=\\rm{Tr}(A)+\\rm{Tr}(B)$ Subspace Some properties of the adjoint operator: Bra Vectors A function $(,):\\mathcal{V} \\times \\mathcal{V} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{C}$. Some properties: A basis set whose elements are orthonormal $\\bra{i},\\ket{j}=\\delta_{ij}$ (like unit vectors). They are complete: $\\sum_i \\ket{i}\\bra{i} = I$. Normal operator : $A$ is normal if $A^\\dagger A = A A^\\dagger$. A normal matrix is Hermitian if and only if it has real eigenvalues. Eigenvectors of an Hermitian operators with distinct eigenvalues are orthogonal.

(More on this on pp. 29–30, Johnston 2021) It obeys all properties of linear operators. Sadun (2008) has a neat discussion in section 6.3 titled 'Bras, Kets, and Duality' pp. 152–156 $(\\ket{v_1}+\\ket{v_2})\\otimes\\ket{w}=\\ket{v_1}\\otimes\\ket{w}+\\ket{v_2}\\otimes\\ket{w}$ Linear operators on $\\mathcal{V}\\otimes \\mathcal{W}$ : If $A: \\mathcal{V} \\rightarrow \\mathcal{V}'$ and $B: \\mathcal{W} \\rightarrow \\mathcal{W}'$ are two linear operators, then $A\\otimes B: \\mathcal{V}\\otimes \\mathcal{W} \\rightarrow \\mathcal{V}' \\otimes \\mathcal{W}'$ is defined as Types of Linear Operators Identity and Pauli Matrices Trace $c(d\\ket{v})=(cd)\\ket{v}$ Singular Value Decomposition Some Useful Relations (incomplete, like other good things in life) $P^\\dagger=P$ Why you may not want to read this page Recommended The vectors in $\\mathcal{B}$ uniquely combine to generate vectors in $\\mathcal{V}$. (Of course! $2\\hat{i}+3\\hat{j}$ is a unique vector in the $\\hat{i}, \\hat{j}$ basis. For a proof, see p. 21 of Johnston 2021). Levi-Civita Existence of an 'inverse': a vector $-\\ket{v}$ such that $\\ket{v}+(-\\ket{v})=\\ket{0}$ Example: Two non-parallel vectors on a plane are linearly independent, three of more of them on a plane are linearly dependent. Notice that an infinite set of vectors can be linearly independent—you only need to show that there are not any finite linear combination of them such that all the scalars used in the combination are zeros. Think about the set $\\{1,x,x^2,\\cdots\\}$. Though the set contains infinitely many elements, it is linearly independent. Because if $\\sum_{i=0}^p c_i x^i=0$ then all $c_i$s are equal to 0. (set $x=0 \\implies c_0=0$; take derivatives and show $c_1=0$ and so on. See p. 17 of Johnston (2021)). So we cannot find any linear combination which is equal to 0 with at least one non-zero coefficient, implying that the set is not linearly dependent. So it's linearly independent! $\\rm{Tr}(A)=\\sum_i A_{ii}$ $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(\\ket{0}-\\ket{1}) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\begin{bmatrix}1 \\\\-1\\end{bmatrix} \\equiv \\ket{-}$ Johnston, N. (2021). Advanced Linear and Matrix Algebra . Springer International Publishing. Span Special case: Measurement operator $M=\\sum_i\\lambda_i P_i$ Orthogonal Vectors A set of vectors $\\mathcal{B} \\subseteq \\mathcal{V}$ is linearly dependent if there exists a set of scalars $c_1,c_2,\\cdots,c_k$, not all zeros, such that $c_i\\ket{v}*i=\\ket{0}$. $\\mathcal{B}$ is linearly independent if it is not linearly dependent. (It's funny 😄, but see the example for what is means.) Similarity Transformation Distributivity: $c(\\ket{v}+\\ket{w}) = c\\ket{v} +c\\ket{w}$ A basis of a vector space $\\mathcal{V}$ is a set of vectors in $\\mathcal{V}$ that spans it and is linearly independent. Example, $\\begin{smallmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{smallmatrix}$ and $\\begin{smallmatrix} 0 \\\\1 \\end{smallmatrix}$ spans $\\mathbb{C}^2$. Examples of vector spaces include $\\mathbb{R}^n$, $\\mathbb{C}^n$, $\\mathcal{M}_{m,n}(\\mathbb{F})$ (space of $m\\times n$ matrices with elements from the field $\\mathbb{F}$). One important point is when it is said that $\\mathcal{V}$ is a vector space over a field $\\mathbb{F}$, it means that the scalars used in the scalar multiplication comes from $\\mathbb{F}$ (also known as a ground field ), not that the elements of the vectors are from $\\mathbb{F}$. For example Hermitian matrices can be defined over $\\mathbb{R}$ or $\\mathbb{C}$, though its elements are from $\\mathbb{C}$. This is important since, for example, the space of $n\\times n$ Hermitian matrices $\\mathcal{M}^{\\rm H}_n$ is not a vector space over $\\mathbb{C}$, but it is a vector space over $\\mathbb{R}$. Example: $A=\\begin{pmatrix} 0 1 \\\\ 1 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\in \\mathcal{M}^{\\rm H}_2$ but since $(iA)^\\dagger\\neq iA$, it's not Hermitian, so $\\mathcal{M}^{\\rm H}_2$ isn't closed under scalar multiplication over $\\mathbb{C}$. Orthonormal Basis Set $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(\\ket{0}+i\\ket{1}) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\begin{bmatrix}1 \\\\i \\end{bmatrix} \\equiv \\ket{y_+}$ Interestingly, if the eigenvectors of $A: \\mathcal{V} \\rightarrow \\mathcal{V}$ have non-degenerate eigenvalues, then they form a basis (eigenbasis) $A = \\sum_i \\lambda_i \\ket{i}\\bra{i}$. Example: our favorite Hamiltonian operator and it's energy eigenvalues: $H=\\sum_E E\\ket{E}\\bra{E}$ $\\ket{v}\\otimes(\\ket{w_1}+\\ket{w_2}) = \\ket{v}\\otimes\\ket{w_1} + \\ket{v}\\otimes\\ket{w_2}$ $\\rm{Tr}(AB)=\\rm{Tr}(BA)$ Functions of Operators Closure under scalar multiplication: $c\\ket{v} \\in \\mathcal{V}$"

She never said anything about why she and her first husband were divorced; she simply said it was very personal and did not think it was relevant for the aspiring female physicists, her target audience. She also was brutally honest about many incidents that were demeaning to her in many ways; she frequently quoted big names saying those horrible things to her. But when she turned out to be wrong, she admitted. The frankness is admirable. This particular book, however, is not about physics. It is written as fables about imaginary physicists navigating an all-too-real world. The stories are thought-provoking, controversial, and candid.

World Scientific Publications As a physicist, it is easy—very easy—to suffer from mild to severe imposter syndrome. Physics is full of brilliant people, often leading one to feel like the only person who doesn’t understand an otherwise “simple” idea that everyone else seems to have seamlessly mastered. I read these biographies as a cure for these bouts of doubt. For me, they often show how exhilarating is the joy of understanding a natural phenomenon; the reason we started doing physics in the first place. This simple joy often gets overlooked when you have to apply for your next postdoc position, next faculty position, or apply for grants. Also, these books show how developing any substantial idea can be very time-consuming, in no sense straightforward, and taxing. Frisch, O. R. (1979). What little I remember .

New (~2024–25): GitHub Repo with Python implementation Also see Lopez-Martinez-Carrasco et al. (2024).  (I tried a Java implementation few years ago; it was useful but a bit clunky.) What's new in it then from clustering? My current understanding (need to check and update): Compared to global methods like decision tree, regression, or compressed sensing, SGD is a local method meaning it does not attempt to classify all the elements of the parent set into subsets, rather it tries to find subclasses which are of high quality with respect to the desired property. Package Define: Propositions $Pi_x = {\\pi_1,\\cdots, \\pi_k}$, Selection language $\\mathcal{L}_x = {\\sigma(i)=\\pi_{j_1}(i)\\wedge\\cdots\\wedge \\pi_{j_t}(i)}$ Ghiringhelli, L.

Lett. 2015 , 114 (10), 105503. https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.114.105503 . Subgroup discovery (SGD) is a local knowledge discovery method.

First, without obsessing over the brutality and sadism of individual Nazi party members, this series provides a complete and unnerving account of how the Nazis, after coming in power, \"won\" the support of German people.

More on these Recounting the experience of individuals brings home, as nothing else can, the sheer complexity of the choices they had to make, and the difficult and often opaque nature of the situations they confronted. Contemporaries could not see things as clearly as we can, with the gift of hindsight: they could not know in 1930 what was to come in 1933, they could not know in 1933 what was to come in 1939 or 1942 or 1945. If they had known, doubtless the choices they made would have been different. One of the greatest problems in writing history is to imagine oneself back in the world of the past, with all the doubts and uncertainties people faced in dealing with a future that for the historian has also become the past. Developments that seem inevitable in retrospect were by no means so at the time, and in writing this book I have tried to remind the reader repeatedly that things could easily have turned out very differently to the way they did at a number of points in the history of Germany in the second half of the nineteenth century and the first half of the twentieth. People make their own history, as Karl Marx once memorably observed, but not under conditions of their own choosing. These conditions included not only the historical context in which they lived, but also the way in which they thought, the assumptions they acted upon, and the principles and beliefs that informed their behavior. A central aim of this book is to re-create all these things for a modern readership, and to remind readers that, to quote another well-known aphorism about history, 'the past is a foreign country: they do things differently there'. —Richard J. Evans A splendid set of books! The first volume deals with the coming in power of the Nazi party; the second volume is about the social, political and many other dimensions of German life under the Nazi rule and, finally, the third volume describes the expansion of the Third Reich and its subsequent downfall in 1945.

From the description: \"Nestled deep in the postcard-perfect French Alps, the Grande Chartreuse is considered one of the world's most ascetic monasteries. In 1984, German filmmaker Philip Gröning wrote to the Carthusian order for permission to make a documentary about them. They said they would get back to him. Sixteen years later, they were ready. Gröning, sans crew or artificial lighting, lived in the monks' quarters for six months—filming their daily prayers, tasks, rituals and rare outdoor excursions. This transcendent, closely observed film seeks to embody a monastery, rather than simply depict one—it has no score, no voiceover and no archival footage. What remains is stunningly elemental: time, space and light. One of the most mesmerizing and poetic chronicles of spirituality ever created, INTO GREAT SILENCE dissolves the border between screen and audience with a total immersion into the hush of monastic life.

    "content": "Moreover, all the microstates with same total energy can be found with equal probability. Swendsen, R. H. (2008). Explaining irreversibility . American Journal of Physics, 76(7), 643–648 . Consider the time evolution of a system $N$ particles. In the $6N$-dimensional phase space, a point $(q_i, p_i)\\equiv(q_1,p_1,q_2,p_2,\\cdots,q_{3N},p_{3N})$ denote one microstate. Loschmidt argued that for a system starting from $(q_i(t_0),p_i(t_0))$ and evolving to $(q_i(t_f),p_f(t_f))$, if we reverse the momenta of all particles at $t_f$—i.e., if we can prepare a system described by $(q_i(t_0),-p_i(t_0))$—then the system should evolve back to the initial state at a later time because the laws of classical mechanics are time reversible. If true, this implies the amazing phenomenon of a gas spontaneously returning to a smaller volume from a larger volume. That means the exactly one final state that allows the system to go back to the initial state is the actual final state can occur with a miniscule probability. As a concrete example, the number of microstate of a system with $N$ particles is proportional to $V^N$. So if you halve the volume, the available microstates decrease by $1/2^N$. So, in the thermodynamic limit, the probability of a gas spontaneously collapsing to half of its volume is $1/2^N \\rightarrow 0$. Greiner, W., Neise, L., & Stöcker, H. (1995). Thermodynamics and Statistical Mechanics. Springer. (pp. 43–46) An overwhelmingly large number of microstates are compatible with a macrostate, specified by a few state quantities like pressure, volume, and temperature. That means the initial state typically evolves to one of numerous possible microstates which cannot be distinguished macroscopically. Boltzmann solved this paradox by noting that: Recommended"
