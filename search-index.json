When we represent a vector in some basis, we order the basis set so that the vector can be written in terms of its 'coordinates' $[\\ket{v}]_\\mathcal{B} \\equiv (c_1,\\cdots,c_n)$. The coordinates depend on the bases . If $\\mathcal{V}$ is a vector space and $\\mathcal{S} \\subseteq \\mathcal{V}$, then $\\mathcal{S}$ is a subspace iff it is closed under addition and scalar multiplication. (You need not check all ten properties. See p. 9, Johnston (2021) for a proof). Normal operator : $A$ is normal if $A^\\dagger A = A A^\\dagger$. A normal matrix is Hermitian if and only if it has real eigenvalues. Eigenvectors of an Hermitian operators with distinct eigenvalues are orthogonal.

Why you may not want to read this page Inner Product $P=\\sum_{i=1}^k \\ket{i}\\bra{i}$ $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(\\ket{0}-i\\ket{1} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\begin{bmatrix}1 \\\\-i\\end{bmatrix} \\equiv \\ket{y_-}$ $\\ket{v}\\otimes(\\ket{w_1}+\\ket{w_2}) = \\ket{v}\\otimes\\ket{w_1} + \\ket{v}\\otimes\\ket{w_2}$ Notation: $\\ket{\\psi}^{\\otimes 2} \\equiv \\ket{\\psi}\\otimes \\ket{\\psi}$ The number of vectors in a basis sets the dimension of the vector space. If $\\mathcal{V}$ has a basis with $n$ vectors, then any set of $m>n$ vectors will be linearly dependent and any set of $m < n$ vectors cannot span $\\mathcal{V}$. (p. 27, Johnston 2021) A bra vector is a linear functional $\\mathcal{V} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{C}$; i.e. it takes a ket vector to a complex number: $(\\bra{v})\\ket{w} = \\braket{v}{w}$. Cohen Tannoudji (2020) showed that the space of all such linear functionals forms another vector space $V^*$—known as the dual space of $V$ (pp. 103–108). A bra vector is an element of $V^*$ . A bra vector can also be represented as an adjoint vector: $\\ket{v}^\\dagger \\equiv \\bra{v}$. $P^2 =P$ Eigenvectors $\\rm{Tr}(A+B)=\\rm{Tr}(A)+\\rm{Tr}(B)$ Orthonormal Basis Set Trace $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(\\ket{0}+i\\ket{1}) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\begin{bmatrix}1 \\\\i \\end{bmatrix} \\equiv \\ket{y_+}$ Bra Vectors Projector Operator Bases It obeys all properties of linear operators. Existence of an 'inverse': a vector $-\\ket{v}$ such that $\\ket{v}+(-\\ket{v})=\\ket{0}$ Special case: Measurement operator $M=\\sum_i\\lambda_i P_i$ Interestingly, for any ket vector in $V$, there exists a bra vector in $V^*$; but for any bra vector, there may not exist a ket vector if the ket belongs to an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space (Cohen Tannoudji 2020 showed a counter-example). For finite-dimensional vector spaces, they are of the same size, and so you'll always get kets corresponding to bras, though. $\\rm{Tr}(zA)=z\\rm{Tr}(A)$ Types of Linear Operators Distributivity: $(c+d)\\ket{v}=c\\ket{v}+d\\ket{v}$ $1\\ket{v}=\\ket{v}$ Mermin, N. D. (2007). Quantum Computer Science: An Introduction . Cambridge University Press. $\\rm{Tr}(AB)=\\rm{Tr}(BA)$ Associativity: $(\\ket{v}+\\ket{w})+\\ket{x}=\\ket{v}+(\\ket{w}+\\ket{x})$ Gram–Schmidt method is used to make a linearly independent set of vectors an orthonormal basis set. This is done by normalizing the first vector from the linearly independent set to make it the first basis element, and then progressively making the other vectors orthonormal by removing the projections. Wikipedia has a neat illustration, check it. Also Savov (2020) explained it well. Todo: Add a better synopsis later. Functions of Operators First, a definition. The adjoint/Hermitian conjugate of an operator $A$ is the unique operator $A^\\dagger$ that satisfies the relation $(\\ket{v},A\\ket{w})=(A^\\dagger \\ket{v},\\ket{w})$ for any $\\ket{v}$ and $\\ket{w}$. Inner product in a tensor-product space Example: Two non-parallel vectors on a plane are linearly independent, three of more of them on a plane are linearly dependent. Notice that an infinite set of vectors can be linearly independent—you only need to show that there are not any finite linear combination of them such that all the scalars used in the combination are zeros. Think about the set $\\{1,x,x^2,\\cdots\\}$. Though the set contains infinitely many elements, it is linearly independent. Because if $\\sum_{i=0}^p c_i x^i=0$ then all $c_i$s are equal to 0. (set $x=0 \\implies c_0=0$; take derivatives and show $c_1=0$ and so on. See p. 17 of Johnston (2021)). So we cannot find any linear combination which is equal to 0 with at least one non-zero coefficient, implying that the set is not linearly dependent. So it's linearly independent! Closure under addition: $\\ket{v} + \\ket{w} \\in \\mathcal{V}$ $c(d\\ket{v})=(cd)\\ket{v}$ $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(\\ket{0}-\\ket{1}) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\begin{bmatrix}1 \\\\-1\\end{bmatrix} \\equiv \\ket{-}$ Closure under scalar multiplication: $c\\ket{v} \\in \\mathcal{V}$ Some properties of the adjoint operator: Simultaneous Diagonalization Theorem Linear Dependence and Independence Kronecker product as matrix representation for $A\\otimes B$ Let $\\mathcal{V}$ be a set of elements (vectors) with two operations, addition and multiplication with a scalar from a field $\\mathbb{F}$ (typically $\\mathbb{C}$ in QM). $\\mathcal{V}$ is a called vector space if for vectors $\\ket{v},\\ket{w},\\ket{x} \\in \\mathcal{V}$ and scalars $c,d \\in \\mathbb{F}$, the following ten conditions are satisfied: Linear Combination Computational Basis Linear operators on $\\mathcal{V}\\otimes \\mathcal{W}$ : If $A: \\mathcal{V} \\rightarrow \\mathcal{V}'$ and $B: \\mathcal{W} \\rightarrow \\mathcal{W}'$ are two linear operators, then $A\\otimes B: \\mathcal{V}\\otimes \\mathcal{W} \\rightarrow \\mathcal{V}' \\otimes \\mathcal{W}'$ is defined as Polar Decomposition $\\rm{Tr}(A)=\\sum_i A_{ii}$ For a positive operator : $(\\ket{v},A\\ket{v})\\geq 0$. If it is positive, then $A$ is called positive definite. $A^\\dagger A$ is positive for any operator $A$. Sadun (2008) has a neat discussion in section 6.3 titled 'Bras, Kets, and Duality' pp. 152–156 The vectors in $\\mathcal{B}$ uniquely combine to generate vectors in $\\mathcal{V}$. (Of course! $2\\hat{i}+3\\hat{j}$ is a unique vector in the $\\hat{i}, \\hat{j}$ basis. For a proof, see p. 21 of Johnston 2021). Vector Space $(\\ket{v_1}+\\ket{v_2})\\otimes\\ket{w}=\\ket{v_1}\\otimes\\ket{w}+\\ket{v_2}\\otimes\\ket{w}$ Spectral Decomposition $P^\\dagger=P$ Tensor products of (Hermitian, unitary, positive, projector) operators retain those properties. Linear Operators $\\rm{Tr}(A\\ket{\\psi}\\bra{\\psi})=\\bra{\\psi}{A}\\ket{\\psi}$ Useful Examples of vector spaces include $\\mathbb{R}^n$, $\\mathbb{C}^n$, $\\mathcal{M}_{m,n}(\\mathbb{F})$ (space of $m\\times n$ matrices with elements from the field $\\mathbb{F}$). One important point is when it is said that $\\mathcal{V}$ is a vector space over a field $\\mathbb{F}$, it means that the scalars used in the scalar multiplication comes from $\\mathbb{F}$ (also known as a ground field ), not that the elements of the vectors are from $\\mathbb{F}$. For example Hermitian matrices can be defined over $\\mathbb{R}$ or $\\mathbb{C}$, though its elements are from $\\mathbb{C}$. This is important since, for example, the space of $n\\times n$ Hermitian matrices $\\mathcal{M}^{\\rm H}_n$ is not a vector space over $\\mathbb{C}$, but it is a vector space over $\\mathbb{R}$. Example: $A=\\begin{pmatrix} 0 1 \\\\ 1 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\in \\mathcal{M}^{\\rm H}_2$ but since $(iA)^\\dagger\\neq iA$, it's not Hermitian, so $\\mathcal{M}^{\\rm H}_2$ isn't closed under scalar multiplication over $\\mathbb{C}$. Span Similarity Transformation Example: the set of non-invertible $2 \\times 2$ matrices is *not* a subspace of $\\mathcal{M}_2$. $\\begin{smallmatrix}1 0 \\\\ 0 0\\end{smallmatrix}$ and $\\begin{smallmatrix} 0 0 \\\\ 0 1\\end{smallmatrix}$ are non-invertible but their sum $\\begin{smallmatrix}1 0 \\\\ 0 1\\end{smallmatrix}$ is invertible. A basis of a vector space $\\mathcal{V}$ is a set of vectors in $\\mathcal{V}$ that spans it and is linearly independent. Example, $\\begin{smallmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{smallmatrix}$ and $\\begin{smallmatrix} 0 \\\\1 \\end{smallmatrix}$ spans $\\mathbb{C}^2$. A function $(,):\\mathcal{V} \\times \\mathcal{V} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{C}$. Some properties: Nielsen, M. A., & Chuang, I. L. (2010). Quantum computation and quantum information (10th anniversary ed). Cambridge University Press. Orthogonal Vectors Some Useful Relations (incomplete, like other good things in life) A basis set whose elements are orthonormal $\\bra{i},\\ket{j}=\\delta_{ij}$ (like unit vectors). They are complete: $\\sum_i \\ket{i}\\bra{i} = I$. Cohen Tannoudji (2020) (pp. 103–108) and Mermin (2007) pp. 159–164 for careful definition of bra vectors Constructing a basis can be very non-trivial for infinite-dimensional vector spaces. (More on this on pp. 29–30, Johnston 2021) If $\\mathcal{V}$ and $\\mathcal{W}$ are $m$ and $n$ dimensional vector spaces, then $\\mathcal{V} \\otimes \\mathcal{W}$ (read as 'V tensor W') is an $mn$ dimensional vector space. Cohen-Tannoudji, C., Diu, B., & Laloë, F. (2020). Quantum mechanics. Volume 1: Basic concepts, tools, and applications (S. Reid Hemley, N. Ostrowsky, & D. Ostrowsky, Trans.; Second edition). Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA. A self-adjoint/Hermitian operator satisfies $A^\\dagger=A$. $P_i P_j = \\delta_{ij}P_i$ Outer-product representation reduces to diagonal representation (eigendecomposition/orthonormal decomposition) when $\\ket{v_i}, \\ket{w_j}$ are orthonormal eigenvalues of $A$. Outer-product and Diagonal Representation A set of vectors $\\mathcal{B} \\subseteq \\mathcal{V}$ is linearly dependent if there exists a set of scalars $c_1,c_2,\\cdots,c_k$, not all zeros, such that $c_i\\ket{v}*i=\\ket{0}$. $\\mathcal{B}$ is linearly independent if it is not linearly dependent. (It's funny 😄, but see the example for what is means.) A map between two vector spaces $\\mathcal{V}$ and $\\mathcal{W}$, $A: \\mathcal{V} \\rightarrow \\mathcal{W}$, that preserves linearity $A (c_1 \\ket{v_1} + c_2 \\ket{v_2}) = c_1 A \\ket{v_1} + c_2 A \\ket{v_2}$. Generally, it has a matrix representation given by $A\\ket{v_j}=\\sum_i A_{ij}\\ket{w_i}$. The representation depends on the basis. Savov, I. (2020). No Bullshit Guide to Linear Algebra (2nd V2.2 ed. edition). Minireference Co. A unitary operator is a normal operator with $A^\\dagger A = A A^\\dagger=I$. Since $U$ is normal, it's diagonalizable, too. $U$ preserves inner product $(U\\ket{v}, U\\ket{w}) = \\ket{v}\\ket{w}$. $U = \\sum_i \\ket{w_i}\\bra{v_i}$ Tensor Products $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(\\ket{0}+\\ket{1}) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\1 \\end{bmatrix} \\equiv\\ket{+}$ Distributivity: $c(\\ket{v}+\\ket{w}) = c\\ket{v} +c\\ket{w}$ Commutativity: $\\ket{v} + \\ket{w} = \\ket{w} + \\ket{v}$ Interestingly, if the eigenvectors of $A: \\mathcal{V} \\rightarrow \\mathcal{V}$ have non-degenerate eigenvalues, then they form a basis (eigenbasis) $A = \\sum_i \\lambda_i \\ket{i}\\bra{i}$. Example: our favorite Hamiltonian operator and it's energy eigenvalues: $H=\\sum_E E\\ket{E}\\bra{E}$ Levi-Civita Any vector of the form $\\sum^k_{i=1} c_i \\ket{v_i}$ is called a linear combination. Interesting: The Identity matrix *cannot* be written as a linear combination of Pauli matrices. Identity and Pauli Matrices Recommended Spanning set need not be unique . $\\begin{smallmatrix}1 \\\\1 \\end{smallmatrix}$ and $\\begin{smallmatrix}1 \\\\-1 \\end{smallmatrix}$ span $\\mathbb{C}^2$, too. Also, $\\hat{i}$ and $\\hat{j}$ and $45$° anti-clockwise-rotated vectors $(\\hat{i}+\\hat{j})$ and $(-\\hat{i}+\\hat{j})$ both spans $\\mathbb{R}^2$. $\\{I,X,Y,Z\\}$ spans $\\mathcal{M}_2(\\mathbb{C})$. Existence of a 'zero vector' $\\ket{0}$ such that $\\ket{v}+\\ket{0}=\\ket{v}$ Singular Value Decomposition Johnston, N. (2021). Advanced Linear and Matrix Algebra . Springer International Publishing. All *finite* linear combinations of vectors of $\\mathcal{B} \\subseteq \\mathcal{V}$. $\\rm{span}(\\mathcal{B})$ is a subspace of $\\mathcal{V}$. If $\\rm{span}(\\mathcal{B})=\\mathcal{V}$ then $\\mathcal{V}$ is said to be spanned by $\\mathcal{B}$. For example, a vector spans a line and two non-parallel vectors spans $\\mathbb{R}^2$."

American Journal of Physics, 76(7), 643–648 . As a concrete example, the number of microstate of a system with $N$ particles is proportional to $V^N$. So if you halve the volume, the available microstates decrease by $1/2^N$. So, in the thermodynamic limit, the probability of a gas spontaneously collapsing to half of its volume is $1/2^N \\rightarrow 0$. That means the exactly one final state that allows the system to go back to the initial state is the actual final state can occur with a miniscule probability. Recommended Moreover, all the microstates with same total energy can be found with equal probability. An overwhelmingly large number of microstates are compatible with a macrostate, specified by a few state quantities like pressure, volume, and temperature. That means the initial state typically evolves to one of numerous possible microstates which cannot be distinguished macroscopically. Consider the time evolution of a system $N$ particles. In the $6N$-dimensional phase space, a point $(q_i, p_i)\\equiv(q_1,p_1,q_2,p_2,\\cdots,q_{3N},p_{3N})$ denote one microstate. Loschmidt argued that for a system starting from $(q_i(t_0),p_i(t_0))$ and evolving to $(q_i(t_f),p_f(t_f))$, if we reverse the momenta of all particles at $t_f$—i.e., if we can prepare a system described by $(q_i(t_0),-p_i(t_0))$—then the system should evolve back to the initial state at a later time because the laws of classical mechanics are time reversible. If true, this implies the amazing phenomenon of a gas spontaneously returning to a smaller volume from a larger volume. Boltzmann solved this paradox by noting that:"

My current understanding (need to check and update): Compared to global methods like decision tree, regression, or compressed sensing, SGD is a local method meaning it does not attempt to classify all the elements of the parent set into subsets, rather it tries to find subclasses which are of high quality with respect to the desired property.

Quite contrarily, he devoted almost 40% of the third volume detailing the massacre brought upon by the military and the SS on the civilian of the conquered countries.

MacGregor, N. (2014). Germany: Memories of a Nation (1st edition). Penguin. Recommended More on these Recounting the experience of individuals brings home, as nothing else can, the sheer complexity of the choices they had to make, and the difficult and often opaque nature of the situations they confronted. Contemporaries could not see things as clearly as we can, with the gift of hindsight: they could not know in 1930 what was to come in 1933, they could not know in 1933 what was to come in 1939 or 1942 or 1945. If they had known, doubtless the choices they made would have been different. One of the greatest problems in writing history is to imagine oneself back in the world of the past, with all the doubts and uncertainties people faced in dealing with a future that for the historian has also become the past. Developments that seem inevitable in retrospect were by no means so at the time, and in writing this book I have tried to remind the reader repeatedly that things could easily have turned out very differently to the way they did at a number of points in the history of Germany in the second half of the nineteenth century and the first half of the twentieth. People make their own history, as Karl Marx once memorably observed, but not under conditions of their own choosing. These conditions included not only the historical context in which they lived, but also the way in which they thought, the assumptions they acted upon, and the principles and beliefs that informed their behavior. A central aim of this book is to re-create all these things for a modern readership, and to remind readers that, to quote another well-known aphorism about history, 'the past is a foreign country: they do things differently there'. —Richard J. Evans A splendid set of books!

    "content": "An astounding documentary! From the description: \"Nestled deep in the postcard-perfect French Alps, the Grande Chartreuse is considered one of the world's most ascetic monasteries. In 1984, German filmmaker Philip Gröning wrote to the Carthusian order for permission to make a documentary about them. They said they would get back to him. Sixteen years later, they were ready. Gröning, sans crew or artificial lighting, lived in the monks' quarters for six months—filming their daily prayers, tasks, rituals and rare outdoor excursions. This transcendent, closely observed film seeks to embody a monastery, rather than simply depict one—it has no score, no voiceover and no archival footage. What remains is stunningly elemental: time, space and light. One of the most mesmerizing and poetic chronicles of spirituality ever created, INTO GREAT SILENCE dissolves the border between screen and audience with a total immersion into the hush of monastic life.

    "content": "More A mostly cogent analysis of the similarities and dissimilarities between the totalitarian regimes of Lenin, Stalin, and Hitler—and he anticipated that the inclusion of Lenin with the other two will shock many. In the first part, he presents some arguments to convince the reader that Lenin, in the short time he was in power, had shown remarkable similarity with Stalin: punishing and 'liquidating' dissenters, being ruthless with the concerns of common Russians, specially peasants, overruling the possibility of a democracy—at times berating it—, and taking brutal steps to implement communist policies. In the subsequent sections, he shows parallels between Hitler and Stalin. His account of Stalin is particularly well written. While dekulakizing USSR, after the number of rich, and yet unpunished, peasants reached a really low number, it became difficult to determine \"who is a kulak?\". To settle that it was decided that any family with two samovars or a \"status symbol\" was to be considered as a kulak. One astonishing fact about that period is recent analyses show that the cheap slave labour by Gulag inmates was actually counter-productive for Russian economy. Like the common Russians, the party members also faced Stalin's wrath. According to Stalin, if any member committed suicide to evade a show trial, he \"is covering his track and deceiving the party for one last time. Suicide is simply a method to spit on the party for the last time\". The Communist party received enormous support from the citizens, mainly urban population. At the time of show trial of Nikolai Bukharin, after complications regarding the New Economic Policy, many prominent literary figures singed an open letter saying \"We demand the spies' execution! We shall not allow the enemies of the Soviet Union to live\". The writers include, among others, Mikhail Sholokov, Alexei Tolstoy, and surprisingly, Vasily Grossman, who was once saved from imprisonment by Bukharin's direct help. Grossman demanded \"No mercy to the Trotskyite degenerates, the murderous accomplishes of fascism.\" I mean, wow. Gellately sometimes has placed opinions, which are not well supported by data presented in the text, in between well-argued points. Though they do not contradict his claims, I found that problematic. Also while describing the show trials, he did not present the allegations, however superficial they may be, of the Communist party against its members.

Vintage. My thoughts A lucid and thoughtful book; the author has done an impressive job. After describing the basic tenets of Socialism, the author discussed about the existent Socialist tradition before Marx came up with his scientific socialism. I liked the informative analysis on the early Utopians like the popular, but theoretically not so convincing, Etienne Cabet and more sound theorists like Henri de Saint-Simon, Charles Fourier, and Robert Owens. Then the Anarchist theories of Proudhon and Bakunin were also discussed in some detail. This studies were interspersed with the author’s thoughtful comment throughout, which I liked. And here is one slightly unnerving quote from Proudhon: To be governed is to be watched over, inspected, spied on, directed, legislated at, regulated, docketed, indoctrinated, preached at, controlled, assessed, weighed, censored, ordered about, by men who have neither the right nor the knowledge nor the virtue…. That’s government, that’s its justice, that’s its morality! One notable feature of this book is that it scarcely discussed about Marxism as implemented in Russia, North Vietnam, and China. Instead we get a thorough discussion of Cuban and Sweden’s socialism, which is interesting! Also the enrichment, and fragmentation, of Socialist ideal after the rise of Feminist and Left-Green movement were not left.
