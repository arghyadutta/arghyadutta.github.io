If I get time In the first part, he presents some arguments to convince the reader that Lenin, in the short time he was in power, had shown remarkable similarity with Stalin: punishing and 'liquidating' dissenters, being ruthless with the concerns of common Russians, specially peasants, overruling the possibility of a democracy—at times berating it—, and taking brutal steps to implement communist policies. The Communist party received enormous support from the citizens, mainly urban population. At the time of show trial of Nikolai Bukharin, after complications regarding the New Economic Policy, many prominent literary figures singed an open letter saying \"We demand the spies' execution! We shall not allow the enemies of the Soviet Union to live\". The writers include, among others, Mikhail Sholokov, Alexei Tolstoy, and surprisingly, Vasily Grossman, who was once saved from imprisonment by Bukharin's direct help.

Distributivity: $(c+d)\\ket{v}=c\\ket{v}+d\\ket{v}$ A set of vectors $\\mathcal{B} \\subseteq \\mathcal{V}$ is linearly dependent if there exists a set of scalars $c_1,c_2,\\cdots,c_k$, not all zeros, such that $c_i\\ket{v}*i=\\ket{0}$. $\\mathcal{B}$ is linearly independent if it is not linearly dependent. (It's funny 😄, but see the example for what is means.) $\\rm{Tr}(A+B)=\\rm{Tr}(A)+\\rm{Tr}(B)$ Let $\\mathcal{V}$ be a set of elements (vectors) with two operations, addition and multiplication with a scalar from a field $\\mathbb{F}$ (typically $\\mathbb{C}$ in QM). $\\mathcal{V}$ is a called vector space if for vectors $\\ket{v},\\ket{w},\\ket{x} \\in \\mathcal{V}$ and scalars $c,d \\in \\mathbb{F}$, the following ten conditions are satisfied: $1\\ket{v}=\\ket{v}$ $z(\\ket{v}\\otimes\\ket{w})=(z\\ket{v})\\otimes\\ket{w}=\\ket{v}\\otimes(z\\ket{w})$ A self-adjoint/Hermitian operator satisfies $A^\\dagger=A$. Span Recommended Identity and Pauli Matrices $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(\\ket{0}-i\\ket{1} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\begin{bmatrix}1 \\\\-i\\end{bmatrix} \\equiv \\ket{y_-}$ $(\\ket{v_1}+\\ket{v_2})\\otimes\\ket{w}=\\ket{v_1}\\otimes\\ket{w}+\\ket{v_2}\\otimes\\ket{w}$ Tensor Products For a positive operator : $(\\ket{v},A\\ket{v})\\geq 0$. If it is positive, then $A$ is called positive definite. $A^\\dagger A$ is positive for any operator $A$. Examples of vector spaces include $\\mathbb{R}^n$, $\\mathbb{C}^n$, $\\mathcal{M}_{m,n}(\\mathbb{F})$ (space of $m\\times n$ matrices with elements from the field $\\mathbb{F}$). One important point is when it is said that $\\mathcal{V}$ is a vector space over a field $\\mathbb{F}$, it means that the scalars used in the scalar multiplication comes from $\\mathbb{F}$ (also known as a ground field ), not that the elements of the vectors are from $\\mathbb{F}$. For example Hermitian matrices can be defined over $\\mathbb{R}$ or $\\mathbb{C}$, though its elements are from $\\mathbb{C}$. This is important since, for example, the space of $n\\times n$ Hermitian matrices $\\mathcal{M}^{\\rm H}_n$ is not a vector space over $\\mathbb{C}$, but it is a vector space over $\\mathbb{R}$. Example: $A=\\begin{pmatrix} 0 1 \\\\ 1 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\in \\mathcal{M}^{\\rm H}_2$ but since $(iA)^\\dagger\\neq iA$, it's not Hermitian, so $\\mathcal{M}^{\\rm H}_2$ isn't closed under scalar multiplication over $\\mathbb{C}$. $\\ket{v}\\otimes(\\ket{w_1}+\\ket{w_2}) = \\ket{v}\\otimes\\ket{w_1} + \\ket{v}\\otimes\\ket{w_2}$ Vector Space Associativity: $(\\ket{v}+\\ket{w})+\\ket{x}=\\ket{v}+(\\ket{w}+\\ket{x})$ Example: Two non-parallel vectors on a plane are linearly independent, three of more of them on a plane are linearly dependent. Notice that an infinite set of vectors can be linearly independent—you only need to show that there are not any finite linear combination of them such that all the scalars used in the combination are zeros. Think about the set $\\{1,x,x^2,\\cdots\\}$. Though the set contains infinitely many elements, it is linearly independent. Because if $\\sum_{i=0}^p c_i x^i=0$ then all $c_i$s are equal to 0. (set $x=0 \\implies c_0=0$; take derivatives and show $c_1=0$ and so on. See p. 17 of Johnston (2021)). So we cannot find any linear combination which is equal to 0 with at least one non-zero coefficient, implying that the set is not linearly dependent. So it's linearly independent! Outer-product and Diagonal Representation If $\\ket{i}$ and $\\ket{j}$ are orthonormal bases in $\\mathcal{V}$ and $\\mathcal{W}$ then $\\ket{i}\\otimes \\ket{j}$ is a basis for $\\mathcal{V}\\otimes \\mathcal{W}$. If $\\mathcal{V}$ is a vector space and $\\mathcal{S} \\subseteq \\mathcal{V}$, then $\\mathcal{S}$ is a subspace iff it is closed under addition and scalar multiplication. (You need not check all ten properties. See p. 9, Johnston (2021) for a proof). Gram–Schmidt method is used to make a linearly independent set of vectors an orthonormal basis set. This is done by normalizing the first vector from the linearly independent set to make it the first basis element, and then progressively making the other vectors orthonormal by removing the projections. Wikipedia has a neat illustration, check it. Also Savov (2020) explained it well. Todo: Add a better synopsis later. Savov, I. (2020). No Bullshit Guide to Linear Algebra (2nd V2.2 ed. edition). Minireference Co. Kronecker product as matrix representation for $A\\otimes B$ Eigenvectors A unitary operator is a normal operator with $A^\\dagger A = A A^\\dagger=I$. Since $U$ is normal, it's diagonalizable, too. $U$ preserves inner product $(U\\ket{v}, U\\ket{w}) = \\ket{v}\\ket{w}$. $U = \\sum_i \\ket{w_i}\\bra{v_i}$ Singular Value Decomposition The number of vectors in a basis sets the dimension of the vector space. If $\\mathcal{V}$ has a basis with $n$ vectors, then any set of $m>n$ vectors will be linearly dependent and any set of $m < n$ vectors cannot span $\\mathcal{V}$. (p. 27, Johnston 2021) Sadun (2008) has a neat discussion in section 6.3 titled 'Bras, Kets, and Duality' pp. 152–156 Incomplete, brief, and evolving \"lookup table\" on quantum mechanics for personal use, closely following Nielsen and Chuang (2010) and others. There may be typos (even conceptual errors!). If you find one, please tell me about it (argphy@gmail.com). Also, feel free to use the material for your own use. Orthogonal Vectors A basis of a vector space $\\mathcal{V}$ is a set of vectors in $\\mathcal{V}$ that spans it and is linearly independent. Example, $\\begin{smallmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{smallmatrix}$ and $\\begin{smallmatrix} 0 \\\\1 \\end{smallmatrix}$ spans $\\mathbb{C}^2$. Cohen Tannoudji (2020) (pp. 103–108) and Mermin (2007) pp. 159–164 for careful definition of bra vectors Some properties of the adjoint operator: Bra Vectors $\\rm{Tr}(A)=\\sum_i A_{ii}$ Example: the set of non-invertible $2 \\times 2$ matrices is *not* a subspace of $\\mathcal{M}_2$. $\\begin{smallmatrix}1 0 \\\\ 0 0\\end{smallmatrix}$ and $\\begin{smallmatrix} 0 0 \\\\ 0 1\\end{smallmatrix}$ are non-invertible but their sum $\\begin{smallmatrix}1 0 \\\\ 0 1\\end{smallmatrix}$ is invertible. Special case: Measurement operator $M=\\sum_i\\lambda_i P_i$ $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(\\ket{0}+\\ket{1}) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\1 \\end{bmatrix} \\equiv\\ket{+}$ Trace The vectors in $\\mathcal{B}$ uniquely combine to generate vectors in $\\mathcal{V}$. (Of course! $2\\hat{i}+3\\hat{j}$ is a unique vector in the $\\hat{i}, \\hat{j}$ basis. For a proof, see p. 21 of Johnston 2021). Linear Operators It obeys all properties of linear operators. Linear Dependence and Independence Inner Product A bra vector is a linear functional $\\mathcal{V} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{C}$; i.e. it takes a ket vector to a complex number: $(\\bra{v})\\ket{w} = \\braket{v}{w}$. Cohen Tannoudji (2020) showed that the space of all such linear functionals forms another vector space $V^*$—known as the dual space of $V$ (pp. 103–108). A bra vector is an element of $V^*$ . A bra vector can also be represented as an adjoint vector: $\\ket{v}^\\dagger \\equiv \\bra{v}$. Linear Combination A function $(,):\\mathcal{V} \\times \\mathcal{V} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{C}$. Some properties: Types of Linear Operators $\\rm{Tr}(AB)=\\rm{Tr}(BA)$ Distributivity: $c(\\ket{v}+\\ket{w}) = c\\ket{v} +c\\ket{w}$ Spectral Decomposition Mermin, N. D. (2007).

Existence of a 'zero vector' $\\ket{0}$ such that $\\ket{v}+\\ket{0}=\\ket{v}$ Spanning set need not be unique . $\\begin{smallmatrix}1 \\\\1 \\end{smallmatrix}$ and $\\begin{smallmatrix}1 \\\\-1 \\end{smallmatrix}$ span $\\mathbb{C}^2$, too. Also, $\\hat{i}$ and $\\hat{j}$ and $45$° anti-clockwise-rotated vectors $(\\hat{i}+\\hat{j})$ and $(-\\hat{i}+\\hat{j})$ both spans $\\mathbb{R}^2$. $\\{I,X,Y,Z\\}$ spans $\\mathcal{M}_2(\\mathbb{C})$. Projector Operator Polar Decomposition $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(\\ket{0}+i\\ket{1}) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\begin{bmatrix}1 \\\\i \\end{bmatrix} \\equiv \\ket{y_+}$ Bases Some Useful Relations (incomplete, like other good things in life) Inner product in a tensor-product space First, a definition. The adjoint/Hermitian conjugate of an operator $A$ is the unique operator $A^\\dagger$ that satisfies the relation $(\\ket{v},A\\ket{w})=(A^\\dagger \\ket{v},\\ket{w})$ for any $\\ket{v}$ and $\\ket{w}$. $P=\\sum_{i=1}^k \\ket{i}\\bra{i}$ $P_i P_j = \\delta_{ij}P_i$ A basis set whose elements are orthonormal $\\bra{i},\\ket{j}=\\delta_{ij}$ (like unit vectors). They are complete: $\\sum_i \\ket{i}\\bra{i} = I$. Subspace $P^2 =P$ Outer-product representation reduces to diagonal representation (eigendecomposition/orthonormal decomposition) when $\\ket{v_i}, \\ket{w_j}$ are orthonormal eigenvalues of $A$. Similarity Transformation When we represent a vector in some basis, we order the basis set so that the vector can be written in terms of its 'coordinates' $[\\ket{v}]_\\mathcal{B} \\equiv (c_1,\\cdots,c_n)$. The coordinates depend on the bases . Levi-Civita $P^\\dagger=P$ Commutativity: $\\ket{v} + \\ket{w} = \\ket{w} + \\ket{v}$ Sadun, L. A. (2008). Applied linear algebra: The decoupling principle (2nd ed). American Mathematical Society. $c(d\\ket{v})=(cd)\\ket{v}$ Closure under scalar multiplication: $c\\ket{v} \\in \\mathcal{V}$ Constructing a basis can be very non-trivial for infinite-dimensional vector spaces. (More on this on pp. 29–30, Johnston 2021) $\\rm{Tr}(A\\ket{\\psi}\\bra{\\psi})=\\bra{\\psi}{A}\\ket{\\psi}$ Useful Orthonormal Basis Set If $\\mathcal{V}$ and $\\mathcal{W}$ are $m$ and $n$ dimensional vector spaces, then $\\mathcal{V} \\otimes \\mathcal{W}$ (read as 'V tensor W') is an $mn$ dimensional vector space. Computational Basis Any vector of the form $\\sum^k_{i=1} c_i \\ket{v_i}$ is called a linear combination. Interesting: The Identity matrix *cannot* be written as a linear combination of Pauli matrices. Existence of an 'inverse': a vector $-\\ket{v}$ such that $\\ket{v}+(-\\ket{v})=\\ket{0}$ Closure under addition: $\\ket{v} + \\ket{w} \\in \\mathcal{V}$ Interestingly, if the eigenvectors of $A: \\mathcal{V} \\rightarrow \\mathcal{V}$ have non-degenerate eigenvalues, then they form a basis (eigenbasis) $A = \\sum_i \\lambda_i \\ket{i}\\bra{i}$. Example: our favorite Hamiltonian operator and it's energy eigenvalues: $H=\\sum_E E\\ket{E}\\bra{E}$ All *finite* linear combinations of vectors of $\\mathcal{B} \\subseteq \\mathcal{V}$. $\\rm{span}(\\mathcal{B})$ is a subspace of $\\mathcal{V}$. If $\\rm{span}(\\mathcal{B})=\\mathcal{V}$ then $\\mathcal{V}$ is said to be spanned by $\\mathcal{B}$. For example, a vector spans a line and two non-parallel vectors spans $\\mathbb{R}^2$. Normal operator : $A$ is normal if $A^\\dagger A = A A^\\dagger$. A normal matrix is Hermitian if and only if it has real eigenvalues. Eigenvectors of an Hermitian operators with distinct eigenvalues are orthogonal. $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(\\ket{0}-\\ket{1}) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\begin{bmatrix}1 \\\\-1\\end{bmatrix} \\equiv \\ket{-}$ Simultaneous Diagonalization Theorem Functions of Operators $\\rm{Tr}(zA)=z\\rm{Tr}(A)$ A map between two vector spaces $\\mathcal{V}$ and $\\mathcal{W}$, $A: \\mathcal{V} \\rightarrow \\mathcal{W}$, that preserves linearity $A (c_1 \\ket{v_1} + c_2 \\ket{v_2}) = c_1 A \\ket{v_1} + c_2 A \\ket{v_2}$. Generally, it has a matrix representation given by $A\\ket{v_j}=\\sum_i A_{ij}\\ket{w_i}$. The representation depends on the basis. Linear operators on $\\mathcal{V}\\otimes \\mathcal{W}$ : If $A: \\mathcal{V} \\rightarrow \\mathcal{V}'$ and $B: \\mathcal{W} \\rightarrow \\mathcal{W}'$ are two linear operators, then $A\\otimes B: \\mathcal{V}\\otimes \\mathcal{W} \\rightarrow \\mathcal{V}' \\otimes \\mathcal{W}'$ is defined as Notation: $\\ket{\\psi}^{\\otimes 2} \\equiv \\ket{\\psi}\\otimes \\ket{\\psi}$ Nielsen, M.

It portrays the contribution of Joseph Goebbels, the Reich Propaganda minister, in mobilizing the people to a war for the \"Living space\". Second, the series provides a rare glimpse into the life of the common members of the Nazi party, Nazi party bosses and, also, ordinary German folks. How did the Germans react to the overbearing regime of the Nazi party? Were they happy under its rule? Did they share the murderous attitude of Nazi party towards \"subhuman(!)\" Polish and Slovakian people and, worst of them all, according to Nazi ideology, Jewish people? As expected, these questions do not have a binary answer and the author explored them with the help of many diaries (most notably, a jew's—Victor Klemperer's—and a Nazi party member's, Melita Maschmann's). Finally, it's reassuring to learn about humane actions done by some Germans to help the oppressed and to observe that the Germans did not lose their sense of humor even under such oppressive regime, as evidenced by many jokes mentioned in the book. Though, let me be clear, this does not at all means that Evans has tried to defend the German atrocities committed during the war. Quite contrarily, he devoted almost 40% of the third volume detailing the massacre brought upon by the military and the SS on the civilian of the conquered countries. The first volume deals with the coming in power of the Nazi party; the second volume is about the social, political and many other dimensions of German life under the Nazi rule and, finally, the third volume describes the expansion of the Third Reich and its subsequent downfall in 1945. I liked these books for a number of reasons: More on these Recounting the experience of individuals brings home, as nothing else can, the sheer complexity of the choices they had to make, and the difficult and often opaque nature of the situations they confronted. Contemporaries could not see things as clearly as we can, with the gift of hindsight: they could not know in 1930 what was to come in 1933, they could not know in 1933 what was to come in 1939 or 1942 or 1945. If they had known, doubtless the choices they made would have been different. One of the greatest problems in writing history is to imagine oneself back in the world of the past, with all the doubts and uncertainties people faced in dealing with a future that for the historian has also become the past. Developments that seem inevitable in retrospect were by no means so at the time, and in writing this book I have tried to remind the reader repeatedly that things could easily have turned out very differently to the way they did at a number of points in the history of Germany in the second half of the nineteenth century and the first half of the twentieth. People make their own history, as Karl Marx once memorably observed, but not under conditions of their own choosing. These conditions included not only the historical context in which they lived, but also the way in which they thought, the assumptions they acted upon, and the principles and beliefs that informed their behavior. A central aim of this book is to re-create all these things for a modern readership, and to remind readers that, to quote another well-known aphorism about history, 'the past is a foreign country: they do things differently there'. —Richard J. Evans A splendid set of books!

Algorithm (tentative, need to check) What's new in it then from clustering? My current understanding (need to check and update): Compared to global methods like decision tree, regression, or compressed sensing, SGD is a local method meaning it does not attempt to classify all the elements of the parent set into subsets, rather it tries to find subclasses which are of high quality with respect to the desired property. Optimize: $f(Q)=\\textrm{cov}(Q)^\\gamma \\textrm{eff}(Q)_+$ where $Q=\\{i \\in S: \\sigma(i)= \\textrm{True}\\}$ (extension), $\\textrm{cov}(Q)=|Q|/|S|$ (coverage), $\\textrm{eff}(Q)= \\frac{H_y(S)-H_y(Q)}{H_y(S)}$ (effect), and $H_y(Q) = -\\sum_v p_Q(y=v) \\log p_Q(y=v)$ (entropy). Recommended It has been used to find out subgroup properties that contribute to one of the two crystal structures of 82 octet binaries (Ghiringhelli et al. 2015). SGD predicts two subgroups which contain elements that have either a zinc blend structure or a rock salt structure (Goldsmith et al 2017, Boley et al. 2017).

    "content": "Consider the time evolution of a system $N$ particles. In the $6N$-dimensional phase space, a point $(q_i, p_i)\\equiv(q_1,p_1,q_2,p_2,\\cdots,q_{3N},p_{3N})$ denote one microstate. Loschmidt argued that for a system starting from $(q_i(t_0),p_i(t_0))$ and evolving to $(q_i(t_f),p_f(t_f))$, if we reverse the momenta of all particles at $t_f$—i.e., if we can prepare a system described by $(q_i(t_0),-p_i(t_0))$—then the system should evolve back to the initial state at a later time because the laws of classical mechanics are time reversible. If true, this implies the amazing phenomenon of a gas spontaneously returning to a smaller volume from a larger volume. That means the exactly one final state that allows the system to go back to the initial state is the actual final state can occur with a miniscule probability. Moreover, all the microstates with same total energy can be found with equal probability. Recommended An overwhelmingly large number of microstates are compatible with a macrostate, specified by a few state quantities like pressure, volume, and temperature. That means the initial state typically evolves to one of numerous possible microstates which cannot be distinguished macroscopically. Greiner, W., Neise, L., & Stöcker, H. (1995). Thermodynamics and Statistical Mechanics. Springer. (pp. 43–46) Boltzmann solved this paradox by noting that: Swendsen, R. H. (2008). Explaining irreversibility . American Journal of Physics, 76(7), 643–648 . As a concrete example, the number of microstate of a system with $N$ particles is proportional to $V^N$. So if you halve the volume, the available microstates decrease by $1/2^N$. So, in the thermodynamic limit, the probability of a gas spontaneously collapsing to half of its volume is $1/2^N \\rightarrow 0$."

University of California Press. Archive Gaillard, M. K. (2015). A singularly unfeminine profession: One woman’s journey in physics . World Scientific Publishing Company. If you want to read a book about a physicist who did brilliant work, made her way through the jungle of academia to the top, and fought against daily, casual sexism from her colleagues, friends, and family members, and yet somehow managed not to hate them, read this book. You won't be disappointed. Hoad, P. (2024). ‘He was in mystic delirium’: was this hermit mathematician a forgotten genius whose ideas could transform AI – or a lonely madman? . Phil Hoad; Guardian And yet the book's tone is not accusatory; she is not into the blame game. She never said anything about why she and her first husband were divorced; she simply said it was very personal and did not think it was relevant for the aspiring female physicists, her target audience. She also was brutally honest about many incidents that were demeaning to her in many ways; she frequently quoted big names saying those horrible things to her. But when she turned out to be wrong, she admitted. The frankness is admirable. Frisch, O. R. (1979). What little I remember . Cambridge University Press. Archive Recommended More on it A short and delightful book by Pierre-Gilles de Gennes, a French Nobel laureate in Physics. He had a distinctive research style. He could, somehow , distill essential insights from complex physical phenomena, and then present them with minimal equations and clear, concise prose. This particular book, however, is not about physics. It is written as fables about imaginary physicists navigating an all-too-real world. The stories are thought-provoking, controversial, and candid.

Physics is full of brilliant people, often leading one to feel like the only person who doesn’t understand an otherwise “simple” idea that everyone else seems to have seamlessly mastered. I read these biographies as a cure for these bouts of doubt. For me, they often show how exhilarating is the joy of understanding a natural phenomenon; the reason we started doing physics in the first place. This simple joy often gets overlooked when you have to apply for your next postdoc position, next faculty position, or apply for grants. Also, these books show how developing any substantial idea can be very time-consuming, in no sense straightforward, and taxing. A series where Rob Phillips is interviewed by David Zierler for the Caltech Heritage project. Inspiring and bold! This book is exceptionally well-written from both of these perspectives. Mary K. Gaillard is Berkeley's first tenured female faculty. Getting that position as a male physicist was not easy, as a female physicist it was close to impossible. She made it possible.

J., & Napolitano, J. (2021). Modern quantum mechanics (3rd ed). Cambridge University Press. Recommended It's very much worth watching despite the poor recording quality. Griffiths, D. J., & Schroeter, D. F. (2018). Introduction to quantum mechanics (Third edition). Cambridge University Press. It's at Griffiths's level and comes with several detailed examples. Though not as popular, it does provide a solid introduction. I have discovered this gem surprisingly late. Bohm lucidly discussed several topics which are hard to find in other books (one example would be statistical properties of correlations for classical and quantum systems, see chapter 10!) From YouTube Introduction to Quantum Information Science by Artur Ekert. Flügge, S. (1999). Practical quantum mechanics . Springer. I love this book! The chapters on rotational invariance, addition of angular momenta, scattering theory, and path integral are particularly good. Quantum entanglement by Mark Wilde An easier version of Sakurai's book. (And there exists a cheaper Indian edition.) Ekert is a patient teacher. The accompanying free book is useful, too. Bohm, D. (1989). Quantum Theory . Dover Publications. Das, A. (2006). Field Theory: A Path Integral Approach (2nd ed., Vol. 75). World Scientific. Lectures on Quantum Computing . One of the best graduate-level QM book. Precise and concise."

Official Into Great Silence US Trailer YouTube . An astounding documentary! From the description: \"Nestled deep in the postcard-perfect French Alps, the Grande Chartreuse is considered one of the world's most ascetic monasteries. In 1984, German filmmaker Philip Gröning wrote to the Carthusian order for permission to make a documentary about them. They said they would get back to him. Sixteen years later, they were ready. Gröning, sans crew or artificial lighting, lived in the monks' quarters for six months—filming their daily prayers, tasks, rituals and rare outdoor excursions. This transcendent, closely observed film seeks to embody a monastery, rather than simply depict one—it has no score, no voiceover and no archival footage. What remains is stunningly elemental: time, space and light. One of the most mesmerizing and poetic chronicles of spirituality ever created, INTO GREAT SILENCE dissolves the border between screen and audience with a total immersion into the hush of monastic life. More meditation than documentary, it's a rare, transformative theatrical experience for all.\" If I Get Time So if I bend my ear To silence, I grown aware The stir of sounds I have almost heard That are not quite there."
