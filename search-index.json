    "content": " If you want to read a book about a physicist who did brilliant work, made her way through the jungle of academia to the top, and fought against daily, casual sexism from her colleagues, friends, and family members, and yet somehow managed not to hate them, read this book. You won't be disappointed. If I get time Gennes, P.-G. de. (2004). Petit point: A candid portrait on the aberrations of science . World Scientific Publications As a physicist, it is easy—very easy—to suffer from mild to severe imposter syndrome. Physics is full of brilliant people, often leading one to feel like the only person who doesn’t understand an otherwise “simple” idea that everyone else seems to have seamlessly mastered. I read these biographies as a cure for these bouts of doubt. For me, they often show how exhilarating is the joy of understanding a natural phenomenon; the reason we started doing physics in the first place. This simple joy often gets overlooked when you have to apply for your next postdoc position, next faculty position, or apply for grants. Also, these books show how developing any substantial idea can be very time-consuming, in no sense straightforward, and taxing. Frisch, O. R. (1979). What little I remember . Cambridge University Press. Archive Mlodinow, L. (2003). Feynman’s Rainbow: A Search for Beauty in Physics and in Life . Warner Books. Recommended More on it A short and delightful book by Pierre-Gilles de Gennes, a French Nobel laureate in Physics. He had a distinctive research style. He could, somehow , distill essential insights from complex physical phenomena, and then present them with minimal equations and clear, concise prose. This particular book, however, is not about physics. It is written as fables about imaginary physicists navigating an all-too-real world. The stories are thought-provoking, controversial, and candid. Having spent a fair amount of time in academia, I know how true most of them are. I recommend it to anyone interested in the social dynamics of scientists. Hoad, P.

She never said anything about why she and her first husband were divorced; she simply said it was very personal and did not think it was relevant for the aspiring female physicists, her target audience.

    "content": "Swendsen, R. H. (2008). Explaining irreversibility . American Journal of Physics, 76(7), 643–648 . Greiner, W., Neise, L., & Stöcker, H. (1995). Thermodynamics and Statistical Mechanics. Springer. (pp. 43–46) Recommended An overwhelmingly large number of microstates are compatible with a macrostate, specified by a few state quantities like pressure, volume, and temperature. That means the initial state typically evolves to one of numerous possible microstates which cannot be distinguished macroscopically. Moreover, all the microstates with same total energy can be found with equal probability. Boltzmann solved this paradox by noting that: Consider the time evolution of a system $N$ particles. In the $6N$-dimensional phase space, a point $(q_i, p_i)\\equiv(q_1,p_1,q_2,p_2,\\cdots,q_{3N},p_{3N})$ denote one microstate. Loschmidt argued that for a system starting from $(q_i(t_0),p_i(t_0))$ and evolving to $(q_i(t_f),p_f(t_f))$, if we reverse the momenta of all particles at $t_f$—i.e., if we can prepare a system described by $(q_i(t_0),-p_i(t_0))$—then the system should evolve back to the initial state at a later time because the laws of classical mechanics are time reversible. If true, this implies the amazing phenomenon of a gas spontaneously returning to a smaller volume from a larger volume. That means the exactly one final state that allows the system to go back to the initial state is the actual final state can occur with a miniscule probability. As a concrete example, the number of microstate of a system with $N$ particles is proportional to $V^N$. So if you halve the volume, the available microstates decrease by $1/2^N$. So, in the thermodynamic limit, the probability of a gas spontaneously collapsing to half of its volume is $1/2^N \\rightarrow 0$."

What's new in it then from clustering? My current understanding (need to check and update): Compared to global methods like decision tree, regression, or compressed sensing, SGD is a local method meaning it does not attempt to classify all the elements of the parent set into subsets, rather it tries to find subclasses which are of high quality with respect to the desired property.

Computational Basis The number of vectors in a basis sets the dimension of the vector space. If $\\mathcal{V}$ has a basis with $n$ vectors, then any set of $m>n$ vectors will be linearly dependent and any set of $m < n$ vectors cannot span $\\mathcal{V}$.

(It's funny 😄, but see the example for what is means.) For a positive operator : $(\\ket{v},A\\ket{v})\\geq 0$. If it is positive, then $A$ is called positive definite. $A^\\dagger A$ is positive for any operator $A$. Some Useful Relations (incomplete, like other good things in life) Inner Product Gram–Schmidt method is used to make a linearly independent set of vectors an orthonormal basis set. This is done by normalizing the first vector from the linearly independent set to make it the first basis element, and then progressively making the other vectors orthonormal by removing the projections. Wikipedia has a neat illustration, check it. Also Savov (2020) explained it well. Todo: Add a better synopsis later. Bra Vectors Types of Linear Operators Normal operator : $A$ is normal if $A^\\dagger A = A A^\\dagger$. A normal matrix is Hermitian if and only if it has real eigenvalues. Eigenvectors of an Hermitian operators with distinct eigenvalues are orthogonal. Linear Dependence and Independence Vector Space Cohen Tannoudji (2020) (pp. 103–108) and Mermin (2007) pp. 159–164 for careful definition of bra vectors Distributivity: $(c+d)\\ket{v}=c\\ket{v}+d\\ket{v}$ Similarity Transformation A self-adjoint/Hermitian operator satisfies $A^\\dagger=A$.

For finite-dimensional vector spaces, they are of the same size, and so you'll always get kets corresponding to bras, though. Any vector of the form $\\sum^k_{i=1} c_i \\ket{v_i}$ is called a linear combination. Interesting: The Identity matrix *cannot* be written as a linear combination of Pauli matrices. Interestingly, if the eigenvectors of $A: \\mathcal{V} \\rightarrow \\mathcal{V}$ have non-degenerate eigenvalues, then they form a basis (eigenbasis) $A = \\sum_i \\lambda_i \\ket{i}\\bra{i}$. Example: our favorite Hamiltonian operator and it's energy eigenvalues: $H=\\sum_E E\\ket{E}\\bra{E}$ A basis of a vector space $\\mathcal{V}$ is a set of vectors in $\\mathcal{V}$ that spans it and is linearly independent.

No Bullshit Guide to Linear Algebra (2nd V2.2 ed. edition). Minireference Co. Examples of vector spaces include $\\mathbb{R}^n$, $\\mathbb{C}^n$, $\\mathcal{M}_{m,n}(\\mathbb{F})$ (space of $m\\times n$ matrices with elements from the field $\\mathbb{F}$). One important point is when it is said that $\\mathcal{V}$ is a vector space over a field $\\mathbb{F}$, it means that the scalars used in the scalar multiplication comes from $\\mathbb{F}$ (also known as a ground field ), not that the elements of the vectors are from $\\mathbb{F}$. For example Hermitian matrices can be defined over $\\mathbb{R}$ or $\\mathbb{C}$, though its elements are from $\\mathbb{C}$. This is important since, for example, the space of $n\\times n$ Hermitian matrices $\\mathcal{M}^{\\rm H}_n$ is not a vector space over $\\mathbb{C}$, but it is a vector space over $\\mathbb{R}$. Example: $A=\\begin{pmatrix} 0 1 \\\\ 1 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\in \\mathcal{M}^{\\rm H}_2$ but since $(iA)^\\dagger\\neq iA$, it's not Hermitian, so $\\mathcal{M}^{\\rm H}_2$ isn't closed under scalar multiplication over $\\mathbb{C}$. Let $\\mathcal{V}$ be a set of elements (vectors) with two operations, addition and multiplication with a scalar from a field $\\mathbb{F}$ (typically $\\mathbb{C}$ in QM). $\\mathcal{V}$ is a called vector space if for vectors $\\ket{v},\\ket{w},\\ket{x} \\in \\mathcal{V}$ and scalars $c,d \\in \\mathbb{F}$, the following ten conditions are satisfied: Nielsen, M. A., & Chuang, I. L. (2010). Quantum computation and quantum information (10th anniversary ed). Cambridge University Press. Outer-product and Diagonal Representation Subspace Existence of a 'zero vector' $\\ket{0}$ such that $\\ket{v}+\\ket{0}=\\ket{v}$ Mermin, N. D. (2007). Quantum Computer Science: An Introduction . Cambridge University Press. Commutativity: $\\ket{v} + \\ket{w} = \\ket{w} + \\ket{v}$ Levi-Civita A bra vector is a linear functional $\\mathcal{V} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{C}$; i.e. it takes a ket vector to a complex number: $(\\bra{v})\\ket{w} = \\braket{v}{w}$. Cohen Tannoudji (2020) showed that the space of all such linear functionals forms another vector space $V^*$—known as the dual space of $V$ (pp. 103–108). A bra vector is an element of $V^*$ . A bra vector can also be represented as an adjoint vector: $\\ket{v}^\\dagger \\equiv \\bra{v}$. Span Spectral Decomposition Kronecker product as matrix representation for $A\\otimes B$ $c(d\\ket{v})=(cd)\\ket{v}$ Constructing a basis can be very non-trivial for infinite-dimensional vector spaces. (More on this on pp. 29–30, Johnston 2021) Why you may not want to read this page Associativity: $(\\ket{v}+\\ket{w})+\\ket{x}=\\ket{v}+(\\ket{w}+\\ket{x})$ Tensor Products Example: Two non-parallel vectors on a plane are linearly independent, three of more of them on a plane are linearly dependent. Notice that an infinite set of vectors can be linearly independent—you only need to show that there are not any finite linear combination of them such that all the scalars used in the combination are zeros. Think about the set $\\{1,x,x^2,\\cdots\\}$. Though the set contains infinitely many elements, it is linearly independent. Because if $\\sum_{i=0}^p c_i x^i=0$ then all $c_i$s are equal to 0. (set $x=0 \\implies c_0=0$; take derivatives and show $c_1=0$ and so on. See p. 17 of Johnston (2021)). So we cannot find any linear combination which is equal to 0 with at least one non-zero coefficient, implying that the set is not linearly dependent. So it's linearly independent! Simultaneous Diagonalization Theorem Closure under scalar multiplication: $c\\ket{v} \\in \\mathcal{V}$ Some properties of the adjoint operator: Linear Operators Spanning set need not be unique . $\\begin{smallmatrix}1 \\\\1 \\end{smallmatrix}$ and $\\begin{smallmatrix}1 \\\\-1 \\end{smallmatrix}$ span $\\mathbb{C}^2$, too.

Bases A basis set whose elements are orthonormal $\\bra{i},\\ket{j}=\\delta_{ij}$ (like unit vectors). They are complete: $\\sum_i \\ket{i}\\bra{i} = I$. Existence of an 'inverse': a vector $-\\ket{v}$ such that $\\ket{v}+(-\\ket{v})=\\ket{0}$ Identity and Pauli Matrices A unitary operator is a normal operator with $A^\\dagger A = A A^\\dagger=I$. Since $U$ is normal, it's diagonalizable, too. $U$ preserves inner product $(U\\ket{v}, U\\ket{w}) = \\ket{v}\\ket{w}$. $U = \\sum_i \\ket{w_i}\\bra{v_i}$ Linear Combination When we represent a vector in some basis, we order the basis set so that the vector can be written in terms of its 'coordinates' $[\\ket{v}]_\\mathcal{B} \\equiv (c_1,\\cdots,c_n)$. The coordinates depend on the bases . $1\\ket{v}=\\ket{v}$ Closure under addition: $\\ket{v} + \\ket{w} \\in \\mathcal{V}$ Sadun (2008) has a neat discussion in section 6.3 titled 'Bras, Kets, and Duality' pp. 152–156 Orthonormal Basis Set All *finite* linear combinations of vectors of $\\mathcal{B} \\subseteq \\mathcal{V}$. $\\rm{span}(\\mathcal{B})$ is a subspace of $\\mathcal{V}$. If $\\rm{span}(\\mathcal{B})=\\mathcal{V}$ then $\\mathcal{V}$ is said to be spanned by $\\mathcal{B}$. For example, a vector spans a line and two non-parallel vectors spans $\\mathbb{R}^2$. If $\\mathcal{V}$ is a vector space and $\\mathcal{S} \\subseteq \\mathcal{V}$, then $\\mathcal{S}$ is a subspace iff it is closed under addition and scalar multiplication. (You need not check all ten properties. See p. 9, Johnston (2021) for a proof). $\\rm{Tr}(A+B)=\\rm{Tr}(A)+\\rm{Tr}(B)$ Sadun, L. A. (2008). Applied linear algebra: The decoupling principle (2nd ed).
