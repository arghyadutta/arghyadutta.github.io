                It focuses on the political history of Bengal since the time of Mahabharata and to the 1970s. Yes a bit too broad, but the author has done a good job in documenting the major political upheavals. I liked a nuanced discussion on the gradual deterioration of Hindu–Muslim relations, starting 1900. Though, at times, the writing is dry and descriptive, it mostly reads well. One issue: a history book should have some decent maps and charts delineating the successions of kings; it lacks those.

        An interesting, well-written book. At times, I disagreed with author who seems a bit weary of religion, but she worked hard for this book and have interesting things to say. Recommended.

            Candid, witty, and sometimes sarcastic, the book starts with a take on colonial India. It then moves into the author’s experiences working as a historian—in the National Archives, at Delhi University, and later at Oxford. A great pick if you're looking for something that's both fun to read and full of insight into India and how an Indian sees Europe. There's also an abridged English translation called "The World in Our Time: A Memoir".
