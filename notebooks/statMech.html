<h1>Statistical mechanics</h1>

        Broad yet concise. The chapter on the general properties of the partition function has a nice discussion on the zeroes of the partition function and connections to phase transition.

        Feynman, R. (1998). <em>Statistical Mechanics: A Set Of Lectures</em>. Taylor & Francis.

        Good book with a spectacular beginning where he puts the partition function in the place it deserves.

        My favorite book regarding field-theoretic formulation of critical phenomena. The chapters on the perturbative renormalization group of $\phi^4$ theories are superb.

        <li>I should mention that if you're actually trying to calculate higher-order Feynman diagrams, Kleinert and Schulte-Frohlinde's &quot;Critical Properties of \(\phi^4\)-Theories&quot; is <em>the reference</em> you need.</li>
        <li>Also, in this connection, I found a neat discussion on mean field theories (particularly \(\phi^6\) theory related to tricritical points) in Nishimori and Ortiz's &quot;Elements of Phase Transitions and Critical Phenomena.&quot;</li>
        <li>R. Swendsen's &quot;An Introduction to Statistical Mechanics and Thermodynamics&quot; is a great book and, unusually, starts with detailed discussions on entropy. (The book has slightly unwieldy, verbose notations, but I think explicit notations help.)</li>
        <li>Ryogo Kubo's statistical mechanics books are some of the most didactic books I've ever read. Very much recommended.</li>
        <li>I read Onsager's solution of the 2D Ising model during masters (along with its complete solution!). It's not easy, but if you <em>really need</em> to know about exactly solvable models, I think the best resource is Rodney Baxter's &quot;Exactly Solved Models in Statistical Mechanics.&quot;</li>
        <li>For numerical approaches in stat mech, I liked D. J. Tildesley and M.P. Allen's &quot;Computer Simulation of Liquids&quot; most for its clean, accessible discussions (for instance, check the discussion on ensembles in MD simulations.)</li>
        <li>A book that I read only a bit—but was thoroughly impressed by its depth—is Richard Tolman's &quot;The Principles of Statistical Mechanics.&quot; Have to read it sometime in the future…</li>
        <li>Dalvit, Frastai, and Lawrie's &quot;Problems on Statistical Mechanics&quot; is excellent (more so because it comes with solutions!) Check it if you want to know, for example, under which conditions bosons with a \(p^s\) dispersion relation in \(d\)-dimensions will form a condensate…</li>
        <li>Finally, on nonequilibrium stat mech, I liked reading Pavel Krapivsky, Sidney Redner, and Eli Ben-Naim's &quot;Kinetic View of Statistical Physics.&quot; The chapters on aggregation, fragmentation, and adsorption are particularly good.</li> -->
