<h1>Statistical mechanics</h1>

        Broad yet concise. The chapter on the general properties of the partition function has a nice discussion on the zeroes of the partition function and connections to phase transition.

        Ryogo Kubo's books are some of the most didactic books I've ever read. Strongly recommended.

    <dd>
        If you're trying to calculate higher-order Feynman diagrams for scalar field theories, Kleinert and Schulte-Frohlinde's book is <em>the best reference</em>.

        Good book with a spectacular beginning where he puts the partition function in the place it deserves.

    <dd>
        My favorite book regarding field-theoretic formulation of critical phenomena. The chapters on the perturbative renormalization group of $\phi^4$ theories are superb.
    </dd>

    </dt>
    <dd>
        It has a neat discussion on mean field theories (particularly $\phi^6$ theory related to tricritical points).
    </dd>
    <dt>
        Swendsen, R. H. (2019). <em>An Introduction to Statistical Mechanics and Thermodynamics</em> (2nd ed.). Oxford University Press.
    </dt>
    <dd>
        A thorough book and—unusually—starts with detailed discussions on entropy. The book uses slightly unwieldy, verbose notations, but I think explicit notations is a feature here, not a problem.

        <li>I read Onsager's solution of the 2D Ising model during masters (along with its complete solution!). It's not easy, but if you <em>really need</em> to know about exactly solvable models, I think the best resource is Rodney Baxter's &quot;Exactly Solved Models in Statistical Mechanics.&quot;</li>
        <li>For numerical approaches in stat mech, I liked D. J. Tildesley and M.P. Allen's &quot;Computer Simulation of Liquids&quot; most for its clean, accessible discussions (for instance, check the discussion on ensembles in MD simulations.)</li>
        <li>A book that I read only a bit—but was thoroughly impressed by its depth—is Richard Tolman's &quot;The Principles of Statistical Mechanics.&quot; Have to read it sometime in the future…</li>
        <li>Dalvit, Frastai, and Lawrie's &quot;Problems on Statistical Mechanics&quot; is excellent (more so because it comes with solutions!) Check it if you want to know, for example, under which conditions bosons with a \(p^s\) dispersion relation in \(d\)-dimensions will form a condensate…</li>
        <li>Finally, on nonequilibrium stat mech, I liked reading Pavel Krapivsky, Sidney Redner, and Eli Ben-Naim's &quot;Kinetic View of Statistical Physics.&quot; The chapters on aggregation, fragmentation, and adsorption are particularly good.</li> -->
