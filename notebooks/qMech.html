    <dd>
        For me, the best graduate-level QM book. Precise and concise. (And the exercises are <em>very</em> carefully designed.)

    </dt>
    <dd>
        An easier version of Sakurai's book.

    <dd>
        A solid undergrad-level textbook. The chapter on solutions to time-independent Schrödinger equation is neat. (Though for learning the formalism, I prefer Sakurai's book.)

        It's at Griffiths's level and comes with several detailed examples. Though not as popular, it does provide a solid introduction.

        It teaches QM through problem-solving. The problems are not easy, but by solving them, you can learn a lot and gain confidence.

        Shankar, R. (1994). <em>Principles of quantum mechanics</em> (2nd ed). Plenum Press.

        I love this book! The chapters on rotational invariance, addition of angular momenta, scattering theory, and path integral are particularly good.

    </dt>
    <dd>
        For the path integral formalism of QM, the first few chapters of Ashok Das's book provide a pedagogic introduction.

        Norsen, T. (2017). <em>Foundations of Quantum Mechanics: An Exploration of the Physical Meaning of Quantum Theory</em> (1st ed.). Springer International Publishing
    </dt>
    <dd>
        Foundations of quantum mechanics is a great subject, until you want to publish, of course. Norsen's accessible and mildly opinionated book provides a good introduction.

        Peres, A. (2010). <em>Quantum theory: Concepts and methods</em>. Kluwer Acad. Publ.
    </dt>
    <dd>
        Asher Peres's book goes deep early on and is easily the most difficult of all the books mentioned in this list. It's very rewarding, though.
