        <li>For me, the best graduate-level QM book is Sakurai's &quot;Modern Quantum Mechanics.&quot; Precise and concise. (And the exercises are <em>very</em> carefully designed.)</li>
        <li>I like to think John Townsend's excellent &quot;A Modern Approach to Quantum Mechanics&quot; as an easier version of Sakurai's book.</li>
        <li>Griffiths's &quot;Introduction to Quantum Mechanics&quot; is a good undergrad-level QM textbook. The chapter on solutions to time-independent SchrÃ¶dinger equation is neat. (Though, for learning the formalism I prefer Sakurai's book.)</li>
        <li>Another undergrad-level QM book I liked is Stephen Gasiorowicz's &quot;Quantum Physics.&quot; It's at the level of Griffiths's and comes with many detailed examples. Though not as popular, it does provide a solid introduction.</li>
        <li>&quot;Practical quantum mechanics&quot; by Siegfried FlÃ¼gge teaches QM through problem-solving. It's not easy, but by solving its problems, you can learn a lot and gain confidence.</li>
        <li>I love R. Shankar's graduate-level &quot;Principles of Quantum Mechanics.&quot; The chapters on rotational invariance, addition of angular momenta, scattering theory, and path integral are particularly good.</li>
        <li>I would like to mention that for the path integral formalism of QM, the first few chapters of Ashok Das's &quot;Field Theory: A Path Integral Approach&quot; provide a pedagogic introduction.</li>
        <li>Only recently, I started reading about the foundations of QM. It's a great subjectâ€”until you want to publish. ðŸ˜€ So far, I liked two books. The first one is &quot;Foundations of Quantum Mechanics&quot; by Travis Norsen. Very accessible (though I found it slightly opinionated)</li>
        <li>The second one is &quot;Quantum Theory: Concepts and Methods&quot; by Asher Peres. I've bought it recently and read only a bit. It goes deep into QM and is easily the most difficult of all the books I mentioned. Very rewarding, though.</li>
