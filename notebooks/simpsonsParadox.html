<h1>Simpson's Paradox</h1>

<blockquote>
    …a trend appears in several different groups of data but disappears or reverses when these groups are combined. This result is often encountered in social-science and medical-science statistics and is particularly problematic when frequency data is unduly given causal interpretations. The paradox can be resolved when causal relations are appropriately addressed in the statistical modeling. (From <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simpson%27s_paradox">Wikipedia</a>)
</blockquote>

<p>
    Are <a href="subgroupDiscovery.html">subgroup discovery</a> and Simpson's paradox related? I believe they are, though I haven't fully developed the idea yet. My thinking is that computing a global regression line can be misleading when the data contain strong local patterns that are not aligned with each other. I don't think this is something new, but it would be interesting to explore the idea a bit further.
