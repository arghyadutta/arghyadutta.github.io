        TMK has strong opinions, and I often disagree with him, but the book is informative, empathetic, and well-written—just read it carefully.

        Informative and sometimes fun, but the overall snobbish tone ruined it for me.

        Sheila Dhar’s witty reflections on the world of Indian classical music. Some descriptions are unforgettable, like when Pandit Pran Nath tuned a Tanpura for over an hour until it sounded just perfect.

        Ethnographic studies of choirs in Shillong and Goa to explore choral singing and postcolonial musical practices, highlighting the interplay of individual and collective identities. The tone is academic, yet it's accessible and well-written—a fairly rare occurrence.
