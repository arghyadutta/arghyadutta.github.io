            <blockquote>
                In my beginning is my end. In succession<br>
                Houses rise and fall, crumble, are extended,<br>
                Are removed, destroyed, restored, or in their place<br>
                Is an open field, or a factory, or a by-pass.<br>
                Old stone to new building, old timber to new fires,<br>
                Old fires to ashes, and ashes to the earth<br>
                Which is already flesh, fur and faeces,<br>
                Bone of man and beast, cornstalk and leaf.<br>
                Houses live and die: there is a time for building<br>
                And a time for living and for generation<br>
                And a time for the wind to break the loosened pane<br>
                And to shake the wainscot where the field-mouse trots<br>
                And to shake the tattered arras woven with a silent motto.<br>

        <summary>Like this one:</summary>
        
        <blockquote>
            An abandoned courtyard: an old tree:<br>
            A temple bell lying on its side:<br>
            The world I live in.<br><br>

            They win and we lose; we lose and they win.<br>
            Vines wrap around the rotting bones.<br><br>

            She knows he wonâ€™t come back from the army, but patches the clothes he left just in case.<br>
        </blockquote>
        Or this (I <em>feel</em> this):
        <blockquote>
            I am about to scream madly in the office,<br>
            Especially when they bring more papers to pile higher<br>
            on my desk.
