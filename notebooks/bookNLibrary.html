            <blockquote>
                And anyway, what about the cultures that haven’t developed what we call philosophy? That’s what I meant just now by saying that anthropology is just as important. The notion of a ‘philosophical concept’, for instance, is a purely Western one. Try explaining ‘concept’ to an Indian—even a highly sophisticated one—or ‘transcendence’ to a Chinese person!
