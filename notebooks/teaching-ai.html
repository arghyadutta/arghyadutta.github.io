<h1>Teaching in the Age of LLMs</h1>

<p>
<em>Some thoughts on teaching in the age of LLMs. I wrote <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7429040040338653185/">a version of it</a> after seeing Shadab Alam's post on LinkedIn (2026-02-16 Monday).</em>
</p>

<p>I'm teaching Python to third-year BSc Physics students who haven't taken any coding courses before at our university. Some heuristics that I am finding useful for teaching students who—to make an understatement—take help of LLMs for almost every course-related thought process:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Convincing students—via realistic examples (e.g., reading and processing data from an excel file)—that coding teaches us to break down a large, complex problem into smaller, manageable chunks. This technique of solving problems isn't only useful for coding, but for research as well. I also mentioned Polya's idea of solving a simpler problem if the original one is too hard. I felt the students appreciated this idea.</li>
<li>Telling them that the language syntax is important, but secondary for this course. I found a cheat sheet of sorts detailing basic python syntax helps here.</li>
<li>Live coding in class (<a href="https://github.com/arghyadutta/intro-python-r">Git repo for my class</a>)</li>
<li>Asking the students to solve problems on a blackboard (this can be done meaningfully only in a small class).</li>
<li>Analyzing LLM-generated code in class and discussing where it can be improved, for example, by pointing out unnecessarily complicated bits of code.</li>
<li>Openly mentioning how they can learn from LLM (asking to explain a code block, for example), and where and how I take help from LLM (for example, to generate boilerplate code to demonstrate an idea).</li>

<li> Two interesting perspectives on this: <a href="https://hilariusbookbinder.substack.com/p/should-academics-collaborate-with">Should academics collaborate with AI? Less than you might think</a> and

</ul>
