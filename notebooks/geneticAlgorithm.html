<h1>Genetic Algorithm (GA)</h1>

<p>
    GA is a type of evolutionary computing. It imitates biological evolution to find the `fittest' solution to an optimization problem. So, it is another optimization algorithm like gradient descent or exhaustive search. The fitness is determined by a <em>fitness function</em>.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Procedure:</b> It defines a population of chromosomes, which are candidate solutions to the optimization problem). It then does the following operations on the initial set of parents: selection, crossover, mutation, elicitation. (pp. 2–4, Carr 2014)
</p>


<b>Example:</b> See pp. 6–8 and pp. 11–16, Carr 2014 for examples of discrete and continuous optimization problems, respectively. The solution of the Traveling Salesman problem is on pp. 22–27, Carr 2014.

<p>
    One practical example is shown in Kim et al. 2021 who designed new polymers starting from a set of parent polymers with the goal of achieving high glass-transition temperature $T_\text{g}$ (to ensure mechanical stability at high temperatures) and high band-gap $E_\text{g}$ (to ensure protection from dielectric breakdown). They proposed 192 new polymers that may have that function based on designing new polymers using GA and then evaluating the $T_\text{g}$ and $E_\text{g}$ of those from pre-trained ML models.
