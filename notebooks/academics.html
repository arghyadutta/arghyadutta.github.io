            A short and delightful book by Pierre-Gilles de Gennes, a French Nobel laureate in Physics. He had a distinctive research style. He could, <em>somehow</em>, distill essential insights from complex physical phenomena, and then present them with minimal equations and clear, concise prose.

            This particular book, however, is not about physics. It is written as fables about imaginary physicists navigating an all-too-real world. The stories are thought-provoking, controversial, and candid. Having spent a fair amount of time in academia, I know how true most of them are. I recommend it to anyone interested in the social dynamics of scientists.
