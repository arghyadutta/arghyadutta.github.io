<h1>Loschmidt Paradox</h1>

<p>
    Consider the time evolution of a system $N$ particles. In the $6N$-dimensional phase space, a point $(q_i, p_i)\equiv(q_1,p_1,q_2,p_2,\cdots,q_{3N},p_{3N})$ denote one microstate. Loschmidt argued that for a system starting from $(q_i(t_0),p_i(t_0))$ and evolving to $(q_i(t_f),p_f(t_f))$, if we reverse the momenta of all particles at $t_f$—i.e., if we can prepare a system described by $(q_i(t_0),-p_i(t_0))$—then the system should evolve back to the initial state at a later time because the laws of classical mechanics are time reversible. If true, this implies the amazing phenomenon of a gas spontaneously returning to a smaller volume from a larger volume.

<p>
    Boltzmann solved this paradox by noting that:
</p>

<dl>
    <dt>
        An overwhelmingly large number of microstates are compatible with a macrostate, specified by a few state quantities like pressure, volume, and temperature. That means the initial state typically evolves to one of numerous possible microstates which cannot be distinguished macroscopically.
    </dt>
    <dt>
        Moreover, all the microstates with same total energy can be found with equal probability.
    </dt>
    <dt>
        That means the <em>exactly one</em> final state that allows the system to go back to the initial state is the actual final state can occur with a miniscule probability.
    </dt>
    <dt>
        As a concrete example, the number of microstate of a system with $N$ particles is proportional to $V^N$. So if you halve the volume, the available microstates decrease by $1/2^N$. So, in the thermodynamic limit, the probability of a gas spontaneously collapsing to half of its volume is $1/2^N \rightarrow 0$.
